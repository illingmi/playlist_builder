# playlist_builder

A python script that inputs a sentence and creates a Spotify Playlist where the titles of the songs correspond to the inputted sentence.

For example:

input sentence: "Cats and dogs love to eat treats"

The Spotify playlist result will produce something like:

Song 1: Cats and Dogs
Song 2: Love
Song 3: To Eat
Song 4: Treats

In future this script might scrap Reddit or other websites to find unique text to develop music playlists.
